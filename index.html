        When selectors are combined they should be read from right to left. The selector farthest to the right, directly before the opening curly bracket, is known as the key selector. The key selector identifies exactly which element the styles will be applied to. Any selector to the left of the key selector will serve as a prequalifier.

The first combined selector above, .hotdog p, includes two selectors: a class and a type selector. These two selectors are separated by a single space. The key selector is a type selector targeting paragraph elements. And because this type selector is prequalified with a class selector of hotdog, the full combined selector will only select paragraph elements that reside within an element with a class attribute value of hotdog.

The second selector above, .hotdog p.mustard, includes three selectors: two class selectors and one type selector. The only difference between the second selector and the first selector is the addition of the class selector of mustard to the end of the paragraph type selector. Because the new class selector, mustard, falls all the way to the right of the combined selector, it is the key selector, and all of the individual selectors coming before it are now prequalifiers.
